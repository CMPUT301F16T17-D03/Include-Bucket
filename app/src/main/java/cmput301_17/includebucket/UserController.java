/**
 * Created by michelletagarino on 16-11-11.
 *
 * This is a controller for a UserAccount.
 *     Although somehow not implemented yet, this class will be used to control when the data of a
 *     user is changed (i.e. when the user updates their contact information) --> many changes
 *     to the Login/Register activities will be done later to follow the UML diagram.
 *         Also when a user creates or deletes a request, this class should be communicated with via
 *         an observer/listener class so that the UserAccount model is also updated).
